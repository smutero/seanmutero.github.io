  <h2>What is happening with Ev's</h2>
</div>
<footer>
<p>A problem which now many car manufactures which are getting into the EV bussiness is making their vehicles affordable because not a large percent of the World can affrod a EV because the issue is its expensive to make the cars but then they sell them at a reasonable prise but the issue is they arent getting their money back so its harder to make an EV.EV owners can save money by charging at home rather than at public charging stations and limiting charge times to off-peak electricity hours when energy is the cheapest. They can also conserve battery power by sticking to urban streets as opposed to driving on high-speed roads.</p>

        <h2>What other possibilities could open up for EV's</h2>
        <p>To conclude, we can say that the electric vehicle is not the only way to have an ecological driving. Many alternatives are currently present (hydrogen, biofuel, natural gas…) and will become more and more important in the future.</p>

        <h2>What does the future hold for EV's</h2>
        <p>The future hold's great height for Ev's with the world aiming to get rid of all gas powered cars by 2030 the results look promising with many people in present day wanting to buy the vehicle and it being useful for maintaning the environment many people are investing in EV's because what the future holds. EVs are expected to make up 58% of auto sales by 2030. According to the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers' June market report, the large increase was partly due to the mass launch of new models. It said: “The consumption potential of the auto market will be further released.</p>

    <div class="column">
        <h2>Enviromental issues that come with this</h2>
        <p>A dilema many car manufactures face is the magnets found in permanent magnet motors used in electric vehicles contain rare-earth metals to increase the power output of these motors. The mining and processing of metals such as lithium, copper, and nickel requires significant energy and can release toxic compounds into the surrounding area also Some studies have shown that the manufacturing of a typical EV battery can result in higher carbon emissions compared to gasoline cars. This is due to the significant amount of energy required for the procurement of raw materials and the manufacturing process itself.</p>
